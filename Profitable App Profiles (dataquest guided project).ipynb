    "   For this project we will be focusing on building apps that are avaliable in Google Play Store and Apple Store. We will focus our interest in building apps that are free to downlad. Our main source of revenue would be the in-app ads. This means the more users the app will have, the better the revenue. One of our goals is to find out what type of apps would be worth developing in order to have a bigger target audience. Analysing data from two csv files should help us understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. "

In my opinion they are still relevant because each one of them is unique in it's own way and these companies have many employees. So in my opinion the best strategy would be to develop a game app that is likely to have a great number of users, or another option I would choose wolud be some kind of a productivity app with nice features and nice design that users would be likely to install and engage with.

However, we don't need very precise data for our purposes - we only want to find out which app genres attract the most users, and we don't need perfect precision with respect to the number of users. We are going to leave the numbers as they are, which means that we'll consider that an app with 100.000+ installs has 100.000 installs and so on. To be able to perform computations, however, we'll need to convert each install number from ***string*** to ***float***, this means that we need to remove the commas and the plus characters. To remove characters form strings we can use the str.replace(old, new) method. "

    "With all of this in mind, I would be making two app profiles recommendations. Because the game genre is overly saturated it would be best if we only have that genre for future considerations. For now we can say that building both a productivity app or a beauty app would be the best option for our current goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- My personal initial idea of the productivity app would be an app that hac nice clean, minimal design, includes features like reminders, to-dos, calendars, pomodoro clocks that increases productivity, and also an app that tracks phone usage and gives stats about which apps the user spends the most time on. If it has an interactive desingn and asks the user questions like what's on their mind and gives daily insights so the users canorganize their time, notes and thoughts it surely be loved by users and would surely like it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second recommendation for a profitable app profile would be an app from the Beauty genre, that would recommend beauty products based on skin type, also featuring articles by beauty bloggers giving recommendations about skin care and cosmetic products. This would be profitable because from this kind of app, our revenue would not only depend from the in-app ads, it might be profitable because cosmetic and beauty companies would be interested in partnerships. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, these ideas are only initial, we can expand on them and comntinue our research based on trial and error."
